# The public goods funding stack

This repo is used for project management of the Funding the Commons research on what we consider the current best in class public goods funding stack at this time.

This research started with the question - how can we combine Allo Protocol, Hypercerts and EAS in order to create novel co-ordination mechanisms?

It also provoked the question "what is missing", which lead to the development of the [Hyperstaker project](https://github.com/ZeroBoundLabs/hyperstaker-ui), which is creating the missing building block between prospective and retrospective funding.

### Hyperboards UI
